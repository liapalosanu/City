# CityScience Task

## Description

Task of finding the shortest distance between two nodes in a network. 

## Algorithm

Algorithm chosen is Dijkstra's with an implementation using dictionaries. To improve speed the use of a priority queue would be essential.
[Dijkstra's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra's_algorithm) algorithm traverses the whole network and calculates the minimum distance from the start node to every other node in the network.

## Implementation

In order to run the script, please use the following command:

`python3 shortestPath.py filename startNode endNode`
